== overall thoughts ==

- find all the health wells.
- determine which one has the cleanest, shortest path between it and a mine.
- find the shortest path to the diamond mine.
	- make sure to take into account blocking obstacles.
- take the mine
- circle the health well, getting between the nearest enemy and the well.
- attack the enemy coming in for health.
- attack anyone attacking my mine.
- run back to for health when less than 50 health.
- chase anyone who runs from me.
- avoid anyone camped at health wells
- kill everyone wandering


== order of operations ==
- establish a base
	- most stuff in a 5x5 area
	- as few trees as possible
	- as many mines as possible
	- centered on a health well
	- probably just want the nearest health well.

- first priority is to heal
- second priority get between any enemies and my health well
- third, chase and kill them
- fourth, start grabbing mines
